<p>The set difference operator (e.g., <code>EXCEPT</code> in some SQL variants) is one of the many fundamental operators of relational algebra. However, there are some databases that do not support the set difference operator directly, but which support <code>LEFT JOIN</code> (a kind of outer join), and in practice this can be used instead of a set difference operation to achieve the same effect.</p>\n\n<p>Does this mean that the expressive power of a query language is the same even without the set difference operator, so long as the <code>LEFT JOIN</code> operator is maintained? How would one prove this fact?</p>\n
