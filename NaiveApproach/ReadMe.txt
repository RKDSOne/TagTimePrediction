Implementation is based in python. 
We need to install the following packages to get the program working using pip install
- json, nltk, bs4

Place the question to consider for Tag Prediction or Time Prediction in test.txt.

This folder contains -
1.) TagPrediction.py 
This is used for finding the accuracy of the Naive Approach of Tag Prediction
Run the program using - 
	python TagPrediction.py
Running this program prints the accuracy of using the Naive method to predict the Tags for the test data.

2.) TimePrediction.py 
This is used for finding the accuracy of the Naive Approach of Time Prediction
Run the program using - 
	python TimePrediction.py
Running this program prints the Mean Square Error of using the Naive method to predict the optimal time for each tag on Tags.json

3.) NaivePrediction.py
Place the question to consider for Tag Prediction or Time Prediction in test.txt.
Run the program using - 
	python NaivePrediction.py
Running this program will give the Predicted Tags and Optimal Time to Post the queries for the post in file test.txt
