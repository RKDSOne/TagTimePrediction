# TagTimePrediction
Machine Learning Project : Tag and optimal time prediction for a particular query by applying different machine learning approaches and using the stack exchange dataset

We use machine learning techniques like KNN classiﬁcation method and linear SVM algorithm to predict the appropriate tags of a question to be posted on stack-overﬂow and predict the optimal time to post a particular question on StackOverﬂow. These predictions are made with an aim to increase the chances of getting an early and valid response for the questions posted. Performanceanalysisandevaluationforthedifferentapproaches were implemented to show that SVM is good with Tag Prediction where as a Naive approach is good with Optimal Time Prediction.
