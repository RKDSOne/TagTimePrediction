Implementation is based in python. 
We need to install the following packages to get the program working using pip install
- json, nltk, bs4

Place the question to consider for Tag Prediction in test.txt.

This folder contains two programs
1.) TagPrediction.py 
This is used for finding the accuracy of the KNN Approach
Run the program using - 
	python TagPrediction.py
Running this program prints the accuracy of using the KNN method to predict the Tags.
** This does 5000 x 10000 computations and takes days for execution.

2.) knnPrediction.py
Place the question to consider for Tag Prediction in test.txt.
Run the program using - 
	python knnPrediction.py
Running this program will give the Predicted Tags and Optimal Time to Post the queries for the post in file test.txt
