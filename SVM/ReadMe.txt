Implementation is based in python. 
We need to install the following packages to get the program working using pip install
- json, nltk, bs4, panda, scikit-learn

This folder contains 2 programs -
1) tags.py
Executing the tag prediction algorithm :
Navigate to the folder \SVM\TagPrediction
Run the program using - 
	python tags.py
The algorithm will calculate accuracy for the test data and will also execute a single test case and show its corresponding prediction. The output is shown in \SVM\TagPrediction\TagPredictionOutput.png

2) python optAcc.py
Executing the Optimal time prediction algorithm :
Navigate to the folder \SVM\OptimalTimePrediction
Run the program using - 
	python optAcc.py
The algorithm will calculate mean square error for the test data and will also execute a single test case and show its corresponding prediction. The output is shown in \SVM\OptimalTimePrediction\OptimalTimePredictionOutput.png
